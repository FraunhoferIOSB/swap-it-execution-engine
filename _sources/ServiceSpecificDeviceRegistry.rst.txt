Service Specific Device Registry
==================================


The `Demonstration Scenario <https://github.com/swap-it/demo-scenario>`_ defines a structure SWAP_Order that must be handed over to each service to be executed.
For the Service Specific Device Registry, a device registry will be locally registered in the execution engine for a single service,
so that it is considered only there. The remaining assignment steps are accomplished with the static assignment strategy of the execution engine.
Consequently, an *DeviceRegistry* and a *ResourceAssignment* structure must be defined in the PFDL.

Process Execution
=================
To execute the above-defined PFDL-process, a small `python script <https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/swap-it-execution-engine/blob/main/Tutorial/service_specific_device_registry.py>`_
is required to set up the execution engine and the docker environment:

.. code-block:: python

    import time, os, sys
    #add directories to the system path
    sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../."))
    sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../tests/test_helpers/."))
    #import the main function
    from main import main
    #import the docker environment
    from util.start_docker_compose import DockerComposeEnvironment

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        #configure the required docker environment
        env = DockerComposeEnvironment(["Device_Registry", "Service_Server", "Dashboard"])
        #start the docker environment
        env.run_docker_compose("./Tutorial/docker-compose.yaml")
        #wait until the server started
        time.sleep(10)
        #run the execution engine
        main()
        #shut down the docker environment
        env.stop_docker_compose()


Here, we first need to add the root directory of the repository to the system path to import the main function of the execution engine. Beside, we can re-use the
docker-environment from the test section.

Since the Device registry is registered locally, it can be removed as program argument. Consequently, he process can then be executed from the command line with:

.. code-block:: python

    python Tutorial/service_specific_device_registry.py "opc.tcp://localhost:4840" "Tutorial/PFDL/service_specific_device_registry.pfdl" "dashboard_host_address"="http://localhost:8080" "custom_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:"

so that we can execute the process and map it on the `SWAP-IT Dashboard <https://github.com/iml130/swap-it-dashboard>`_. In case that the log messages of the execution
engine should be captured, the command line argument can be simply adjusted to:

.. code-block:: python

    python Tutorial/service_specific_device_registry.py "opc.tcp://localhost:4840" "Tutorial/PFDL/service_specific_device_registry.pfdl" "dashboard_host_address"="http://localhost:8080" "log_info"=True  "custom_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:"
