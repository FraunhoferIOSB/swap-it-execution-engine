Dynamic Assignment
=========================


The `Demonstration Scenario <https://github.com/swap-it/demo-scenario>`_ defines a structure SWAP_Order that must be handed over to each service to be executed.
For the Dynamic Assignment, a Device Registry is required, as well as an external assignment agent. The assignment agent will be globally registered in the execution engine,
so that it is considered for each assignment step.

Process Execution
=================
To execute the above-defined PFDL-process, a small `python script <https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/swap-it-execution-engine/blob/main/Tutorial/dynamic_assignment.py>`_ is required to set up the execution engine and the docker environment:

.. code-block:: python

    import time, os, sys
    #add directories to the system path
    sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../."))
    sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../tests/test_helpers/."))
    #import the main function
    from main import main
    #import the docker environment
    from util.start_docker_compose import DockerComposeEnvironment

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        #configure the required docker environment
        env = DockerComposeEnvironment(["Device_Registry", "Service_Server", "Dashboard", "Assignment_Agent"])
        #start the docker environment
        env.run_docker_compose("./Tutorial/docker-compose.yaml")
        #wait until the server started
        time.sleep(10)
        #run the execution engine
        main()
        #shut down the docker environment
        env.stop_docker_compose()


Here, we first need to add the root directory of the repository to the system path to import the main function of the execution engine. Beside, we can re-use the
docker-environment from the test section.

For this Tutorial, the terminal command must be extended with three of the optional arguments. First, a global Device Registry is set with the argument *"device_registry_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:8000"*. Besides,
each service server registers itself in the Device Registry with the URI from the docker compose environment, so that the URI returned from the
Device Registry must ab adjusted, to replace the docker-internal URI with a docker-external URI. Here, the optional argument *"custom_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:"* is added, so that each server from the
docker-environment can be reached from outside. Lastly, an assignment agent is globally registered with the argument *"assignment_agent_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:10000"*. In addition to that,
we will set another argument, to increase the number of default clients for the execution engine's control interface. Here, the argument *"number_default_clients"=5* is provided, so that the execution
engine starts with a set of 5 control interface clients.


The process can then be executed from the command line with:

.. code-block:: python

    python Tutorial/dynamic_assignment.py "opc.tcp://localhost:4840" "Tutorial/PFDL/dynamic_assignment.pfdl" "dashboard_host_address"="http://localhost:8080" "device_registry_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:8000" "custom_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:" "number_default_clients"=5 "assignment_agent_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:10000"

so that we can execute the process and map it on the `SWAP-IT Dashboard <https://github.com/iml130/swap-it-dashboard>`_. In case that the log messages of the execution
engine should be captured, the command line argument can be simply adjusted to:

.. code-block:: python

    python Tutorial/dynamic_assignment.py "opc.tcp://localhost:4840" "Tutorial/PFDL/dynamic_assignment.pfdl" "dashboard_host_address"="http://localhost:8080" "log_info"=True "device_registry_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:8000" "custom_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:" "number_default_clients"=5 "assignment_agent_url"="opc.tcp://localhost:10000"
